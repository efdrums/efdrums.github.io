<h2>Now</h2>
<p>A summary of what I'm up to right now. Last updated on July 9, 2025.</p>
<ul class="now">
<li>Updating my websites. This new Now page is something I've thought about for a long time as a place to post items that are too small or temporary for a blog post. I've also recently introduced a dark mode theme to both this website and my blog. I resisted dark mode for a long time, mostly because I wasn't interested in using default themes. But I've found some time to make it feel congruent with the light mode and finally pulled the trigger. As always, this is subject to future tweaks.</li>
<li>Trying to log less screen time and read more. Success varies.</li>
<li>I'm enjoying my new role at front of house with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rockdogs2016">St. Joseph and the Sinners</a>. The guys sound great (with or without me), and I recommend checking them out if you're in Central Ohio!</li>
<li>After rebuilding my workout habit over the past year, I'm dedicating the summer to kettlebell training using programs from <a href="https://kbmuscle.com">Joe Daniels</a>. So far, I'm enjoying both the simplicity and the results.</li>
<li>In other activity-related news, I'm once again attempting to learn to golf. I'm very new to it and not good at all, but this is my longest-lived effort yet. My goal is to play nine holes with my wife and father-in-law at the end of July.</li>
<li>I'm in the beginning phases of my next musical project and returning to my percussive roots! More details on that will be coming soon.</li>
