<h2>Now</h2>
<p>A summary of what I'm up to right now. Last updated on October 12, 2025.</p>
<ul class="now">
<li>Settling into my "school year" rehearsal schedule at church and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GCCWinds">Grove City Community Winds</a>. Things get a bit busier this time of year, but I enjoy the the routine and music-making!</li>
<li>Working to make up some ground on my reading and writing goals before the end of the year.</li>
<li>Continuing to enjoy a few kettlebell-focused workouts a week in the basement gym. The simplicity and variety of exercises that are possible with just a couple of bells is inspiring.</li>
<li>Working on a new musical project that I hope will see the light of day before the end of 2025!</li>
